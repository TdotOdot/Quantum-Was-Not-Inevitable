# Quantum Computing Was Not Inevitable: Operationalizing Non-Commutative Semantic Computing

## Abstract
This repository provides a practical implementation of **Cognitional Mechanics (CM)**, a deterministic computational framework that reclaims non-commutative operator composition from the physical monopoly of quantum mechanics. By treating the order of operations as a standalone structural resource, CM enables high-dimensional semantic processing on classical hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU) without the need for probabilistic collapse or physical quantization.

## Core Axioms
- **Non-Commutativity as Structure**: Information order is the physical state. The sequence of operations defines the semantic trajectory.
- **Abolition of Probability**: Replaces stochastic wave-function collapse with the **Logical Leap**, a deterministic convergence regulator.
- **Hardware Agnostic**: Designed for parallel execution on conventional tensor cores (GPU/TPU) using standard linear algebra.

## Key Components
- **Semantic Manifold**: States are represented as vectors where norm and direction define structural relations rather than probabilities.
- **Deterministic Convergence**: The `C` parameter regulates manifold coherence through a fixed re-projection mechanism.
